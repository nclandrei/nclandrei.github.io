My name is Andrei-Mihai Nicolae and I'm a software engineer from Bucharest, Romania. I enjoy building applications that make a real difference, whether that's helping businesses grow or improving people's lives through technology.

I specialize in Ruby on Rails, React, Python, and Clojure, but I'm always eager to explore new technologies. I've also worked extensively with JavaScript, Go, Java, and Angular.

I'm currently a Staff Engineer at Carta.

I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out at [hello@anicolae.ro](mailto:hello@anicolae.ro).
